Nested Pages provides an intuitive drag and drop interface for managing pages & posts in the WordPress admin, while maintaining quick edit functionality.

For installation and usage information visit [nestedpages.com](http://nestedpages.com). Available for download/installation in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-nested-pages).

## Compatibility
**Nested Pages requires PHP v5.3.2+ and WordPress v3.8+.**

**Why PHP 5.3.2+?:** Nested Pages takes advantage of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), specifically its PSR-4 auto-loading component. Because of this, the minimum version of PHP supported is 5.3.2.

**Why WordPress 3.8+?:** Nested Pages depends on admin theme changes introduced in WordPress 3.8.
