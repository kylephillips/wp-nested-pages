5. Additional options are available through the plugin settings at Settings > Nested Pages. Nested Pages may be enabled for any post type, and is configurable by post type. Options include quick edit field settings, thumbnail display and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Nested Pages with other post types? =
As of Nested Pages version 1.3.0, all post types are supported. To enable the Nested Pages interface for post types, update your settings under Settings > Nested Pages.

= Is this plugin compatible with the WPML plugin? =
Nested Pages is not currently compatible with WPML. Why? Primarily due to WPML's own menu generation options. It is not a matter of making the plugin translatable, but a core plugin feature that is not supported.

= How do I access the WordPress "Pages" screen? =
Click the “Default link in the page subnav, or on the Nested Pages screen. This item may be optionally hidden under the Nested Pages settings.

= How do I save the order I create? =
Post sorting and nesting is saved in the background after changes are made to the structure. If the "manual page order" option is enabled in the plugin options, you'll need to click the "Sync Order" button at the top of the page to save.

= How do I edit in bulk? =
As of version 1.6, bulk edits are available directly through the Nested interface. To edit in bulk, select one or more posts. Choose "Edit" from the bulk actions to edit. Bulk edit functionality is similar to the WordPress core edit. Note: custom links that have been added through the Nested Pages interface are not affected by bulk edit actions.

= What about custom columns? =
As of version 1.6.4, custom columns are available. Visit Settings > Nested Pages > Post Types to enable and order custom columns for each post type. Columns made available through the appropriate WordPress filters are available for selection, along with any taxonomies enabled for the post type. Sortable custom columns are not enabled, however. The sorting of columns would interfere with the automatic ordering and menu syncing of Nested Pages.

= What are those dots in my page rows? =
If you have WordPress SEO by Yoast installed, your page score indicators are shown along with the pages.

= Can I show the thumbnail in the tree view? =
As of version 1.6, yes. Visit Settings > Nested Pages > Post Types to configure thumbnail settings for each post type. Filters are also available for customizing the images displayed.

= Theme Use =

To toggle the page back into view, click the “Show Hidden Pages” link at the top of the screen. The hidden pages are now visible, and can be re-edited to be shown.

To sort pages, hover over the page row. A menu icon (three lines) will appear. Click (or tap) this icon and drag to reorder within the menu. To drag a page underneath another, drag the page to the right and underneath the target parent. Visual indication is provided with an indentation. The drag and drop functionality works similarly to WordPress menus.

= Menu Sync =

After installing Nested Pages, a new menu will be available with the name `Nested Pages`. By default, menu syncing is enabled. To disable the sync, uncheck “Sync Menu” at the top of the Nested Pages screen. Recheck the box to enable it again and to run the sync. 

**Saving Performance:** If your site has a very large number of pages, disabling page sync may help speed up the save time when using Nested Pages.

**Hiding Pages in the Menu:** To hide a page from the Nested Pages menu, click “Quick Edit” on it’s row, select “Hide in Nav Menu”, and click “update”. If menu sync is disabled, enable it now to sync the setting. Hidden pages are marked “(Hidden)”. If a page with child pages is hidden from the menu, all of it’s child pages will also be hidden.
